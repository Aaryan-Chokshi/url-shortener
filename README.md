# python-project

This Python Project involved using a Flask environment to create and manage a database of shortened URLs, as well as their associated longer ones.
The idea was to send in a shortened URL, while the server is running, and it will be automatically replaced by a longer URL.

This project could be expanded with additional features like an expiry limit for the links; after a certain time interval, the link would be deleted from the server's database.

Using our randomization, we can potentially generate upto 56.8 billion different links.
